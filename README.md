# hackjnu_project-submission
The idea which we have chosen as a team is to create synthetic medical images with the help of latest Digital Image Processing Techniques and the GANSs( generative adversarial network ) and for the web Application we have used NextJs:A powerful framework of react js.



# Working of the Applicatiion:-
In this application basically we have 3 ML models.User will give the input of a MRI scan image and our application firstly convert the input image to the enhanced synthetic image after that our 2nd model will convert the output of 1st model to an advanced synthetic image which consists of a coloured image and GIFs and after all this process the the last model will predict that wheather the person is suffering from that disease or not.


As we know that we have developed a Protoype thatwhy we HAVE TAKEN the brain tumour MRI images as an example we will definatly expand this idea on other disease as well in the up comming future.

We have used GANs architecture for the genration of synthetic image and for the web application we have used NEXT-JS
